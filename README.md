Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern applications, making them an integral part of almost every application.
Databases will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course focuses on relational modeling, data modeling with ER charts (tables and relational links) and SQL language handling (data mining, selecting, projecting, joining, aggregating, grouping, modificating, deleting and inserting). Fundamental knowledge about ACID transactions and transaction processing and practical tips for adjusting productivity are provided.
This course sets the basics of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications, and understanding concepts such as database transformation into object-oriented (ORM) modeling.
